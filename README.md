# SentimentAnalysis
This Project aims to analyze sentiments from specific movie reviews using Machine Learning Algorithms in Python.The Dataset acquired from Keggle.com is divided into two seperate folders, "positive" and "negative". The code runs through eache review in every folder stored in .txt files and runs it through four different algorithms, Naive Bayes Model, Logistic Regression Model, SVM Model and K-Nearest Neighbors Model. The highest accuracy is found to be in LR model which is then used to create a user input test code that predicts a random statement provided by the user to be positive or negative. This code can further be enhanced to predict multiple complex sentiments from anger to satisfied.

# NOTE: 
1. Running time of code is 5-8 seconds (needs user input at the end to verify).
2. Change path and path2 to your path of dataset.
